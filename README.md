# Hands-on-Data-Analytics
Individual hands-on code sharing in multiple data analytics areas.

1. Hypothesis_testing_and_random_simulation.ipynb: Pre-processing, visualisation, analyses and hypothesis testing of multifaceted data on HDB in Singapore. Randomised simulation of answers to secretarial questions on the simplified version.

2. HDB_SG_DA.ipynb: Preprocessing, analysis, visualisation and insights of multiple perspectives on HDB resale data in Singapore.

3. Regression_and_modelling.ipynb: Data preprocessing, multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, model analysis

4. Simple Recommendation System.ipynb: Simple processing of student and course data from NUS SOC and production of a course recommendation system.

5. Clustering and Regression.ipynb: Datasets contain information on institutional characteristics, enrollment, costs, and student outcomes for 856 and 851 four-year colleges, respectively, in the United States of America. Cluster the colleges on five variables after standardisation using an appropriately chosen linkage method for Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance. After we fit a regression model in each part, we also assess its fit, study the residuals, check for influential points, and check for multicollinearity.
